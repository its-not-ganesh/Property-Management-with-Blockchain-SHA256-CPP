# Property Management with Blockchain(Sha256)CPP
 Implementation of Property management with Blockchain technology using SHA256 algorithm for hashing in C++
 
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project there are 11 class which are "sha256", "errorException", "Date", "Adhaar", "Person", "Property", "TransactionData", "Block", "BlockChain", "Property_Db", "SuperUser" which all have custom exceptions for the user input. The sha256 class converts a string data into a 64 character long hash which is unique to that data. The Blockchain class has all the Blocks with all the transaction data with the hash. This project aims to improve the security of the Database and the transactions with the Blockchain technology whose architecture helps us acheive that goal.

<h2>How to Run?</h2>
 
 Preferably use any IDE with Cmake where the project can be run directly, if using any other ide configure the files and run th main.cpp file.
